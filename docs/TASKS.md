### CI-001 — GitHub Actions Node.js 24 deprecation warning

| Field          | Detail                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**         | CI-001                                               |
| **Type**       | External dependency                                  |
| **Severity**   | Warning only — not a failure                         |
| **Component**  | actions/checkout, actions/setup-node                 |
| **Status**     | Open — UNBLOCKED, compatible versions have shipped   |
| **Logged**     | 2026-03-19                                           |
| **Resolve by** | 2026-09-16 (Node 20 removed from runners) — Sprint 1 |

**What:** Our workflows pin action majors that still run on Node.js 20
(checkout v4.2.2, setup-node v4.4.0, upload-artifact v4, codeql-action v3).
Node 24 became the default runtime on 2026-06-02; **Node 20 is removed from
GitHub runners on 2026-09-16**, after which these actions stop working.

**Unblocked (verified 2026-07-12):** Node 24-compatible majors have shipped —
`actions/checkout` v6/v7, `actions/setup-node` v6, `actions/upload-artifact` v5+/v7,
`github/codeql-action` v4. Dependabot has already opened PRs for checkout 7.0.0
and upload-artifact 7.0.1.

**Resolution plan:**

1. Bump the action majors in both repos, keeping the SHA-pin + `# vX` comment convention
2. Verify each workflow still passes (ci, codeql, semgrep, load-test, zap-scan, sync)
3. Drop the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` shim once everything is on Node 24
4. Remove this entry

**Close when:** no workflow runs a Node 20 action; no deprecation warning in CI output.

**What:** Code is complete: SsoButtons.tsx, initiateSso(),
handleSsoCallback(), provider interface all built.
Requires: (1) OAuth credentials from Google Cloud, Apple Developer,
Azure AD; (2) Cognito identity provider configuration;
(3) Custom domain on Cognito for callback URLs;

**What:** ECS Fargate public IP changes on task restart.
Add ALB or Elastic IP for stable URL.
Currently using direct IP — acceptable for development,
not production.

### TASK-036 — Expire stale config approvals

| Field        | Detail                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |

### TASK-037 — Config-AI conversational endpoint is a keyword stub

| Field        | Detail                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-037                                                |
| **Type**     | Feature — agentic surface                               |
| **Severity** | Medium                                                  |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5 (Sprint 2/3, on the agentic workflow framework) |
| **Status**   | Open                                                    |
| **Logged**   | 2026-06-21                                              |
| **Source**   | app/api/admin/config-ai/route.ts:179                    |

**What:** The conversational config-AI endpoint (`config-ai/route.ts`)
still returns `buildAcknowledgment()`, a keyword-matching stub — not
LLM-driven. The `/execute` sub-route does real tool dispatch, but the
conversational layer on top does not. The route comment cites "Sprint 4b",
but 4b wired the social and input agents, not this surface.

**Resolution:** build it ON the Phase 5 agentic workflow framework
(`platform/ai/agent.ts`, ADR-029) — system prompt → LLM with the config
tool definitions → tool calls via `executeAgent()` → response. Do not
extend the keyword approach. Verified still-open Phase 5 Sprint 0.

### TASK-038 — Verify useAudioRecorder records ≥10s

| Field        | Detail                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-038                               |
| **Type**     | Reliability verification               |
| **Severity** | Medium                                 |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 7                      |
| **Status**   | Open                                   |
| **Logged**   | 2026-04-25                             |
| **Source**   | TASK-026 rotation — Gotcha G-VOICE-001 |

**What:** ACRCloud requires ≥10s of audio for reliable
fingerprint matching. Verify that `useAudioRecorder` in
Playform enforces a minimum recording duration of 10s
before triggering the identify call. If it records <10s,
users will get `code: 1001 No Result` on valid songs.

### TASK-039 — Evaluate ACRCloud Humming Identification

| Field        | Detail                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-039                     |
| **Type**     | Feature evaluation           |
| **Severity** | Low                          |
| **Phase**    | Phase 6+ (needs ADR)         |
| **Status**   | Open — ADR-021 candidate     |
| **Logged**   | 2026-04-25                   |
| **Source**   | TASK-026 rotation discussion |

**What:** ACRCloud offers humming/Cover Song Identification.
Fits Playform's language-learning UX. Requires: new
`IdentifyMode` enum, split provider interface, mode-aware UI,
confidence display, separate test fixtures.
Estimated ~1.5 sprints. Write ADR-021 before implementation.

### TASK-041 — Verify song-ID health probe is registered

| Field        | Detail                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-041                                |
| **Type**     | Gotcha #27 verification                 |
| **Severity** | Medium                                  |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 1                       |
| **Status**   | Open                                    |
| **Logged**   | 2026-04-25                              |
| **Source**   | TASK-026 rotation pre-flight finding F3 |

**What:** `platform/voice/health-probe.ts` defines a health
probe for `SongIdentificationProvider`, but pre-flight grep
found no registration call in `initObservability()`.
If unregistered, the probe is dead code (Gotcha #27).

**Verified (Phase 5 Sprint 0):** confirmed unregistered — `health-probe.ts` defines the probe (type + class) but no registration call exists in `observability/`, `registry.ts`, or `instrumentation.ts`. Gotcha #27 confirmed; fix still Open.

### TASK-042 — Refactor dual ACRCloud env-var read sites

| Field        | Detail                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-042                                |
| **Type**     | Refactor                                |
| **Severity** | Low                                     |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 1                       |
| **Status**   | Open                                    |
| **Logged**   | 2026-04-25                              |
| **Source**   | TASK-026 rotation pre-flight finding F1 |

**What:** Both `platform/providers/registry.ts` (lines 226–228)
and `platform/voice/acrcloud-identify.ts` (lines 87–89)
independently read `process.env.ACRCLOUD_*`.
Single source of truth violation.

**Verified (Phase 5 Sprint 0):** both read sites confirmed present (registry.ts:226-228, acrcloud-identify.ts:87-89). Still Open.

### TASK-045 — Rebase + maintain Playform GENAI_ROADMAP overlay

| Field        | Detail                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-045                     |
| **Type**     | Documentation / process      |
| **Severity** | Medium                       |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 7            |
| **Status**   | Open                         |
| **Logged**   | 2026-06-21                   |
| **Source**   | Phase 5 entry gate N3 review |

**What:** Playform's docs/GENAI_ROADMAP.md is a sync-excluded
overlay frozen at Sprint 3d (2026-04-27) — missing Sprints 4-7
and the Phase 4 close. Rebase it on PF's current content as the
base layer, then add Playform-specific GenAI content
(AdaptiveInput intent resolution, song ID, translation pipeline,
social-agent wiring, any Playform-only GenAI surfaces). Keep it
sync-excluded.

**Don't-rot guard:** extend the D3/D4 documentation gate so it
runs against both GENAI_ROADMAPs whenever a consumer overlay
exists. D3/D4 only ever ran against PF, which is why the overlay
froze.

### TASK-046 — Auth-enable k6 + live moderation/agent re-baseline

| Field        | Detail                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-046                                      |
| **Type**     | Testing infrastructure / performance baseline |
| **Severity** | Medium                                        |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 7 (phase-exit expectation)    |
| **Status**   | Open                                          |
| **Logged**   | 2026-06-21                                    |
| **Source**   | Phase 5 Sprint 0 k6 re-baseline finding       |

**What:** `k6/api-load.js`'s `DRY_RUN=0` ("live, ~$5") profile is stale — it predates
Sprint 3d, which added `requireAuthWithStatus` to `/api/process` and `/api/stream`. The
script sends no auth header, so every live request 401s at the guard before reaching
moderation, translate/classify, or the orchestrator. A live run today costs ~$0 and
measures only 401-rejection latency.

**Resolution:** add auth to the k6 script — acquire a test-user JWT (sign in via
`/api/auth/sign-in` or mint a token) and send it as `Authorization: Bearer …` on the
`/process` and `/stream` calls. Then run `DRY_RUN=0` against **staging** for the first real
moderation + agent latency baseline. Phase-exit expectation — do not close Phase 5 without it.

**Dry baseline (Phase 5 Sprint 0, for reference):** prod, 10 VUs, 1221 reqs, 0% errors;
process p95 76.9ms, stream p95 71.4ms, health p95 149ms (health p99 tripped on a single ~2s
Vercel cold start).

### TASK-047 — Next 16 middleware → proxy file-convention deprecation

| Field        | Detail                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-047                                             |
| **Type**     | Tech debt — framework deprecation                    |
| **Severity** | Low (warning now; hard error in a future Next major) |
| **Phase**    | Phase 5, Sprint 1                                    |
| **Status**   | Open                                                 |
| **Logged**   | 2026-06-21                                           |
| **Source**   | Sprint 0 dev-server warning (Next 16.2.6)            |

**What:** Next 16 deprecated the `middleware.ts` file convention in favor of `proxy.ts` —
the dev server logs the deprecation on startup, and request logs already show `proxy.ts`
timings. PF-synced file, so both repos are affected. Becomes a hard error in a future Next major.

**Resolution:** rename `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` per the Next 16 migration guide; verify
auth + rate-limit middleware still applies on all routes; run the full gate. PF first (syncs
to Playform).

**Close when:** `middleware.ts` renamed to `proxy.ts` in PF, gate green, and the dev-server
deprecation warning no longer appears.

### TASK-048 — Promote Playform Phase-5-open ROADMAP overlay to main

| Field        | Detail                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**       | TASK-048                                     |
| **Type**     | Process — release                            |

| **Logged**   | 2026-06-21                                   |
| **Source**   | Phase 5 entry — Playform N7/N8 overlay edits |

**What:** Playform's Phase-5-open ROADMAP overlay edits (Phase 5 → In Progress, changelog)
were committed to Playform `develop` (commit `2033172`) during the entry gate but not yet
promoted. `ROADMAP.md` is a sync-excluded overlay, so it does NOT arrive via PF sync — it
needs its own Playform develop → staging → main promotion.

**Close when:** commit `2033172` (and any follow-on overlay edits) is merged to Playform
`main` via the standard PR flow.

| **Source**   | Playform `npx jest` output during the audit-fix gate |

**What:** A Jest worker process hard-crashes with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
exceeded` inside `jest-util`'s soft-deleted-global warning path (`emitAccessWarning` →
`originalSetter` → infinite recursion, jest-util/build/index.js:531-541). It is preceded by
`[JEST-01] DeprecationWarning: 'version' property was accessed on [Object] after it was soft
deleted` — something accesses a global after Jest tears it down between test files.

**Why it matters:** the suite still reports all tests passing and jest exits 0, so **CI does
not catch this**. A crashing worker can mask failures and will get worse: Jest has announced
the soft-delete behavior becomes "on" (hard failure) in a future version.

**Confirmed pre-existing (2026-07-06):** NOT caused by the `npm audit fix` OTel/Sentry bump —
reproduced on the pre-bump lockfile (`865fedc`, 2 occurrences) and the post-bump lockfile
(`d54163e`, 1 occurrence).

**Resolution:** run with `--detect-open-handles` / `--runInBand` to isolate the offending
suite; identify what accesses a global post-teardown (likely a module registering global
instrumentation); fix the leak or set the Jest config option that controls soft-delete
behavior. Check whether PF exhibits it too.

**Close when:** `npx jest` in both repos completes with zero `Maximum call stack size
exceeded` occurrences.

## Known Issue — TASK-020 numbering collision

TASK-020 is used for two different items:

- **SECURITY_DEBT resolved table:** "Redis CacheProvider
  (deferred from Phase 1)" — resolved Phase 2, Sprint 4
- **PHASE3_PLAN + code:** "Google Cloud TTS 5,000-byte limit
  — needs chunking" — resolved Phase 3, Sprint 2

Both are resolved. Pre-existing collision, not introduced by
Sprint 3c. Flagged for awareness.
